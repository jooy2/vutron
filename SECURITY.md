# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

To report a security vulnerability, create an issue on GitHub on the "Open a draft security advisory " page on GitHub: https://github.com/jooy2/vutron/security/advisories/new

Also, send private instructions in advance via maintainer email. Do not submit vulnerability-related content as a general issue.

## Security compliance

Project maintainers are quickly addressing reported security vulnerabilities in the project and providing relevant patches.

We report these to the relevant users and handle the correspondence to prevent the issue from recurring.

## Security recommendations

We recommend that users of project sources use the latest version, which addresses possible security vulnerabilities.
